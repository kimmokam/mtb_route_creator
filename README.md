# Project Title

MTB Route Creator

## Summary

MTB route creator will create your next MTB route automatically. It will take some input from you. For example location, time you have to spend on route, what kind of terrain you would like to have. Using these inputs it will create your route that you can display on map and export it to use on route.

## Background

Last summer we travelled around Finland with our caravan. I had my fatbike with me so I could have a ride in many new places. Problem that I faced in many place was that it was really hard to found any good routes to have a ride. 

There are sites like JÃ¤lki (https://jalki.fi/) and MTB Reitti.fi (https://mtbreitti.fi/) where you can found routes made by others. Other way to found routes is using some sports app where you can find heatmaps that shows where many people have been riding with MTB. These work quite well when you are some place where have been lot of riders. But if you go some smaller place where aint some many riders you normally cannot find any allready made route or the heatmaps arent showing anything. Specially problem with heat maps is that it requires lot of rider and rides before it shows anything.

## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
